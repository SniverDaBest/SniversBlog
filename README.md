## Who am I?
I am a small developer who is making a game. I am great at Python, and I'm trying to learn some other languages like Java, C++, and atleast a little bit of Javascript, since it will be needed eventually.
## What have you been working on?
This is a great question. I've been working on a game called Untitled Pixel Game. It's a 2D adventure game. I originally wanted it to be a game where you de-pixelate the world, which was pixelated by monsters. But I want to change it.
